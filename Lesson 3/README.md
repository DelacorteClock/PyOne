# CookingSort Software

## About

CookingSort is a Python programme which allows you to type info about recipes and then receive the information back about the recipes--in addition to generated skill levels--in a more presentable format.

## How To Use

You can download and run the script and simply follow the instructions but--if you need more of a guide or just wnat to know how it works--you will need to take these steps.

+ Type digit(s) (ie integer) saying how many recipes you want to type.
+ Repeat these steps for each recipe when requested:
	+ Type the recipe name...it will be converted to uppercase later
	+ Type digit(s) (ie integer) to say how long it will take to make
	+ Type ingredients separated by plus signs (NO COMMAS OR SPACES)...and they are not case sensitive just to let you know...they will all be converted to lowercase to make them look different to the recipe names.
+ View the generated recipes (with format and difficulty levels) and the ingredient list. Copy and paste them to save them if you want too.
