# Python Project One

## Lesson One
The programme in this lesson is 'add.py'. The purpose of it is to request two inputs from the user and store them like integers 'a' and 'b'. It then adds them and stores the sum in variable 'c'. It then prints the value of 'c' in a notification to inform the user about the sum. To use it you must give it the two integers to add and then it will tell you the result.
