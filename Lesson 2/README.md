# Lesson Two

In this lesson I had to copy a recipe and store it, put it into a type of array and then make other recipes and put them into the array.

I decided to use a dictionary because of its key value based structure. I needed keys for name, cooking time and ingredients for the project and was able to create them with this structure. I then was able to give them values with appropriate types (str, int and list). This is something which a dictionary is designed for...and even if it could be possible to accomplish something similar with lists it would not be very convenient. Also the dictionaries are flexible (unlike tuples) with support of popping, deleting and editing.

I used a list for all recipes because each recipe is like its own unit and a list is like an array of individual units. Using a dictionary here would be inappropriate and inefficient because it would force the use of completely unnecessary keys. A tuple is similar to a list but not 'mutable' which would make it impractical for something which is always changing. A list can be lengthened, shortened and modified in a convenient way for this situation.
